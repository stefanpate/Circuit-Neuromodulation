# Neuromorphic Neuromodulation
Python implementation of the neuromorphic neuronal model described in:

- [Neuromodulation of Neuromorphic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05696) (Ribar and Sepulchre, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, 2019)
- [Neuromorphic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04441) (Ribar and Sepulchre, 2020)

## Overview
### Model definition
- `neuron_model.py`
- `network_model.py`

The file `neuron_model.py` provides the definitions for the current-based model described in [Ribar and Sepulchre, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05696) and [Ribar and Sepulchre, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04441). A conductance-based extension of the model is provided as well.

A neuron is defined as an interconnection of an arbitrary number of either current source or conductance elements. Each conductance element is defined with a collection of gating variables defining the activation and inactivation dynamics. The dynamics of the current elements, as well as the gating variables, are given by linear first-order filters defined by their timescale.

The file `network_model.py` provides the corresponding definitions for the current-based and conductance-based synaptic connections, along with resistive connections.

A neural network is defined as an arbitrary collection of neurons as defined in `neuron_model.py` and a collection of synapses/resistive connections with their corresponding connectivity matrices.

### Graphical interface
- `gui.py`

The I-V curve shaping graphical interface for controlling the neuronal behavior as detailed in [Ribar and Sepulchre, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05696). The file provides an interface for controlling the parameters of the 4-current bursting model with a live plot of the behavior and the corresponding I-V curves.

Additionally, a graphical interface for controlling an equivalent conductance-based model with 4 activating conductances is provided in `gui_conductance.py`.

The required definitions are provided in `gui_utilities.py`.

### Examples
- `single_neuron_example`
- `network_example`

The examples show how the model definitions are used to construct and simulate neurons and networks of neurons.

### Requirements
- `requirements.txt`
